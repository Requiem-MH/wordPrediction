Written in C++ and using Clang and CMake, this program is a command line word prediction program that predicts
what the user is typing according to what they have already typed.

To run the program, do the following: 
+ ```mkdir build```; Make a build directory to contain all build files
+ ```cp dictionary.txt build```; Copy the dictionary.txt file into build directory you just made
+ ```cd build```; change directories into the build directory
+ ```cmake ..```; call Cmake build system
+ ```make```; Build the executable files
+ ```./TypeAhead```; Run the word prediction program
